    "# Discovery Phase: AI-Powered Mood Tracker and Music Therapy App\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The objective of this phase is to create a base model that can detect users' emotional states (e.g., stress, sadness, happiness) based on multi-modal inputs such as facial recognition, voice analysis, and text sentiment. The base model will also recommend suitable music therapy based on the detected mood.\n",

    "## Key Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Collection\n",
    "- **Facial Expression Data**:\n",
    "  - Collect or access datasets that contain labeled facial expressions (e.g., happy, sad, stressed) using resources like FER2013, AffectNet, or custom datasets.\n",
    "- **Voice Emotion Data**:\n",
    "  - Utilize datasets like RAVDESS, CREMA-D, or custom-recorded voice samples to recognize emotional patterns in speech (e.g., pitch, tone, speed).\n",
    "- **Text Sentiment Data**:\n",
    "  - Leverage sentiment analysis datasets such as IMDB reviews, Twitter sentiment data, or custom journal entries for detecting emotions through text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Model Selection & Prototyping\n",
    "- **Facial Recognition Model**:\n",
    "  - Choose pre-trained models (e.g., CNN-based models for facial expression analysis) such as VGG16, ResNet, or specialized emotion recognition networks.\n",
    "  - Experiment with OpenCV or Mediapipe for real-time facial emotion detection.\n",
    "- **Voice Emotion Recognition**:\n",
    "  - Use LSTM or RNN models for emotion recognition in voice data.\n",
    "  - Pre-process voice data using tools like librosa to extract features like MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients).\n",
    "- **Text Sentiment Analysis**:\n",
    "  - Fine-tune transformer-based models like BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT for text sentiment detection.\n",
    "  - Explore traditional sentiment analysis techniques using bag-of-words or TF-IDF along with classifiers like SVM or Naive Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Model Training\n",
    "- **Multi-modal Fusion**:\n",
    "  - Develop separate models for facial, voice, and text analysis and test their performance individually.\n",
    "  - Combine the outputs of these models using late fusion or decision-level fusion techniques to improve mood detection accuracy.\n",
    "- **Evaluation Metrics**:\n",
    "  - Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate emotion detection models.\n",
    "  - Utilize confusion matrices to better understand the performance across emotional classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Music Recommendation System (Baseline)\n",
    "- **Music Tagging**:\n",
    "  - Categorize music tracks based on mood (e.g., relaxing, uplifting, energizing).\n",
    "  - Use an existing API (e.g., Spotify API) to access playlists or build a dataset with mood-based tags.\n",
    "- **Initial Recommendation Logic**:\n",
    "  - Develop simple recommendation logic: if stress is detected, play relaxing music; if sadness is detected, play uplifting music, etc.\n",
    "  - Personalize recommendations over time based on user feedback and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Timeline\n",
    "- **Week 1-2**: Data collection and dataset exploration for facial, voice, and text sentiment analysis.\n",
    "- **Week 3**: Model selection, experimentation, and prototyping for individual modalities.\n",
    "- **Week 4**: Model training, tuning, and evaluation.\n",
    "- **Week 5**: Basic implementation of music recommendation logic and testing.\n",
    "- **Week 6**: Multi-modal model fusion and initial testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "- After the discovery phase, further refine the models by integrating additional data (e.g., wearable devices).\n",
    "- Improve model accuracy with continuous feedback loops and machine learning adaptation.\n",
    "- Begin development of real-time notification and seamless music playback systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools & Frameworks\n",
    "- **Facial Recognition**: OpenCV, Mediapipe, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch.\n",
    "- **Voice Analysis**: librosa, pyAudioAnalysis, RNN/LSTM architectures.\n",
    "- **Text Sentiment**: Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, traditional NLP techniques.\n",
    "- **Music Recommendation**: Spotify API, YouTube Music API, personalized recommendation algorithms.\n"
